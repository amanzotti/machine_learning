As you might imagine my svn doesn not work yet. It might later but I won't be able to submit at that time.
So everything should be here. The 2 .py files containes everything I have used to produce plots and results.


NOTE

I am really sorry I could not latex the HW.
We do not have a lot of sums etc in astronomy paper and I was really slow in producing them.

 As an advanced last here student I unfortunatelly don't have a lot of time to invest on latexing it. I hope you understand

 If everything is not clear PLEASE PLEASE let me know. I am happy to come to our office or answering email about that.

 Thanks

 Alessandro
